                <p>If you look hard enough on the internet, you'll find some really great articles about design. They can teach you things like how to make a killer SketchUp model or what different types of materials are best for which purpose. But as an honest writer and designer, I know that sometimes those articles don't cover all of the aspects of design that we should be learning about. That's why I want to discuss something that there is a limited amount on — cheating in design.</p>
                <h5>
                    Cheating in Design: Why and How?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we come up with ideas and designs that we're excited about, but they don't work, or it seems like there are roadblocks around every corner just waiting to pop up no matter what direction we take.
                    It's during those times that we need to dig deep and fight back if we want to move forward. Maybe we're just stuck at some part of the design, such as a section that doesn't look as good as it should or something more foundational like the overall shape is off and it's just not coming together. This is when cheating comes in handy.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    But why, you might ask, would I want to cheat?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Cheating can be a great way to overcome your creativity roadblock by taking a shortcut around a problem you might be facing rather than trying to figure out how to fix it with traditional means. With that being said, you should never cheat just because you can.

                    Cheating should be used as a last resort and only as a way to help overcome roadblocks in your design to move forward. You can't trust yourself or your work enough to know if something is going to work, so instead, there has to be a clear purpose for cheating.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Why would I want to cheat?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The main reason we would want to cheat is for the sake of moving our designs forward. By taking shortcuts, we're able to avoid guessing and guessing and guessing again like we might encounter when designing without cheating. To take advantage of our creative minds and force them into action, we need an idea of what we're trying to accomplish.
                    If you want to force your creative mind into action, the main idea is to push forward so you know what you're trying to achieve. This idea can be applied to many different design areas such as design itself, music, film, and even writing, so why not design?

                    Let's say that we're working on a poster that we really like, but it's starting to get less of an aesthetic appeal that we want or even more generic looking. Let's say art is not our major in school, and we're stuck on this one poster for an assignment. But what if we could just cheat?
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, try to solve the problem with your creativity. Use your brain and apply your analytical side to figure out what you can change to improve upon what you have. If it still doesn't work, make a rough mockup of the poster and start getting those ideas flowing. Look at it from all angles and see if there's anything new or different about the poster that will make it better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you still can't find some way to improve upon it, I would not recommend cheating, as you might end up with something that looks more like a piece of garbage than something prime for an assignment or hanging on a wall at home. You might get a pass because it's "art," but if you get caught, you'll be in serious trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's say you're working on a creative concept for your creative concept, which can lead to any number of different ideas. You see the idea's potential, and it looks good, but there's one design element that doesn't seem to work, and you can't seem to fix it. This is another good time to use cheating since you're only using the tools available for this task. You can always pull out some Photoshop effects or image distortions and start playing around with things that may end up looking better anyway. The possibilities are endless once you take advantage of the creative mind in this manner.

                    Another example of how to use this type of cheating is for photography. Maybe you're trying to take some pictures of a model, but your lighting just isn't looking right. You can always jump into Photoshop and start painting over some areas that are too dark or just don't look the way that they should. It's not really cheating if it's within the program you're working with.
